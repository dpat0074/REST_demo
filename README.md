# presentation_demo
This presentation goes over a simple setup of a REST API. In this codebase, we are using Node.js to start up a local server that will have defined endpoints for each HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Listed below is some assumed prior knowledge to get the code setup and have a general understanding of what we are trying to achieve.

## Assumed Prior Knowledge
-npm i (install process for npm packages) \
-node server.js (command to start up server) \
-knowledge that client calls can be done via POSTMAN instead of the browser in the event a front-end (UI) is not ready or created yet.

## Constraints
Due to the time constraints, we will not be able to write out the code together as a 'class', hence - I have created a seperate branch called 'inital_setup' that has the overhead setup without the REST API functionality implemented so you if you like to try on your own, checkout the branch and work from stratch to get to the final solution presented to get a better understanding of what we are trying to achieve.
